# InstallerX

## Introduction

Looking for an application installer? Why not give **InstallerX** a try?

In many customized domestic systems, the experience with the built-in installation programs is not quite optimal. That's where **InstallerX** comes in â€“ you can use it to replace the default system installer.

Of course, in comparison to the native system, **InstallerX** also offers additional installation options: dialog-based installation, installation through the notification bar, automatic installation, declaration of the installer, choice of whether to install it for all user profiles, allowing installation of test packages, permitting downgrades, and automatic deletion of the installation package after installation.

## Supported Versions
